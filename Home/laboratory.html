    <h3> Labratory </h3>

    <h5> Project Objectives </h5>
    <pre>
        Modular Risc-V laptop that would allow for every component to be swapped out, upgraded
        and repaired easily. Cost effective solution for educational or professional environments,
        Synthix Labs aims to have a Open Source Laptop that would contribute to helping technology
        advance forward,

    Catagorized by months. 
        <h6>Month 1.</h6>
        <pre>
            Build and calculate the size, length, width of the shell for the 14 inch laptop.
            Decide on a keyboard layout and how the bottom case will be able to interlock to the case 
            either with screws or a latching mechanism  

            Tools used: 
                Solidworks 

            Envisoned finished product:
                A case built with aluminum or ABS/PLA able to be connected, Speaker grills 
                and a area for the monitor to be latched in with a switch mechanism.
        </pre>
      <h6>Month 2.</h6>
      <pre>
        Design and Implement a custom PCB design with riscv64 chips, after
        designed build a case around motherboard, batteries interconnecting.
