    <h3> Labratory </h3>

    <h5> Project Objectives </h5>
    <pre>
        Modular Risc-V laptop that would allow for every component to be swapped out, upgraded
        and repaired easily. Cost effective solution for educational or professional environments,
        Synthix Labs aims to have a Open Source Laptop that would contribute to helping technology
        advance forward,

    </pre>

    <h4> Timeline</h5>
    Catagorized by months. 
        <h5>Month 1.</h5>
        <pre>
            Build and calculate the size, length, width of the shell for the 14 inch laptop.
            Decide on a keyboard layout and how the bottom case will be able to interlock to the case 
            either with screws or a latching mechanism  

            Tools used: 
                Solidworks 

            Envisoned finished product:
                A case built with aluminum or ABS/PLA able to be connected, Speaker grills 
                and a area for the monitor to be latched in with a switch mechanism.
            </pre>
        <h5>Month 2.</h5>
            <pre>
                Design and Implement a custom PCB design with riscv64 chips, after
                designed build a case around motherboard, batteries interconnecting.
        
                Tools used:
                    Solidworks 

                Envisoned Finished product:
                  Fully working PCB design that would interlock with other 
                    PCBs,

        11/8/2023,
        Case specifications length width finished, Solidworks 
        Waiting on CherryMX low profile switches specifications to determine hole size. 

        11/10/2023,
        Research on mechanism, snapping, latching early because case needs it for the parts,
        the case needs advanced mechanism that i had net learned. proficienty in solidworks needed

        Decided on every component would need modularity 

        Switch to FUSION 360 since SolidWorks is too complicated.
