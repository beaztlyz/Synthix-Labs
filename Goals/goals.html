<h1> Goals </h1>


<h3> Week 1</h3>
    <pre>
        <p> &#8512; Case Design</p>
        &#10146; Learn Fusion 360 so i can begin modeling the top case, bottom case
        &#10146; Research on material and size and dimensions 
        &#10146; Conceptualizing designs and Decide on how modular the thing is 

        <p> Create the Top Case </p>

    </pre>

<h3> Week 2</h3>
    <pre>
        <p> &#8512; Case Design</p>

        <p> Create the Bottom case </p>

        &#10146;Since ram is gpoing to be inserted into the case i need to create a case cover with smaller screws 
        &#10146;Since its the bottom case its going to be the same width and length however the depth is going to be different, 
        &#10146;Design how the air is going to be ciruclated out so exhaust ports for the bottom case. 
    </pre>


<h3> Week 3</h3>
    <pre>
        <p> &#8512; Port, Screws, Case Redesign </p>
        &#10146; Design and reseach what types of ports i should use in the case (USB, ETHERNET)
        &#10146; port hole caluclation and size width latching mechanism in progress
        &#10146; Research on screws and how long and what type of screw 
        <p> sum: Redesign and evaluate the cases, hole placement and where the ram should be,</p>

    </pre>


<h3> Week 4</h3>
    <pre> 
        <p> &#8512; Internal Module and Usb Design </p>
        Design a common size for the port so big or small port can be used 
        Common size for the pcb slotting and do resarch on what type of pin connection and electrical current, watt amp , i need
        Research on lathcing mechanisms for the usb ports 
        &#10146; 

    </pre>


<h3> Week 5</h3>
    <pre>
        <p> &#8512; Keyboard Design</p>
        &#10146; Research on keycaps size and modeling of the keys 
        &#10146; Design a system on which all the keys will be pulled down when the laptop closes 
        &#10146; Electrical voltage and dimension calculation, switches buying, designing keycaps 
    </pre>

<h3> Week 6 </h3>
    <pre>
        <p> PCB Design </p>
         &#10146; Component, Part and material research
        &#10146;  implementation of learned items into making a uncomplete pcb for review
                order parts and begin assembly of the PCB

    </pre>
<h3>    Week 7   </h3>
