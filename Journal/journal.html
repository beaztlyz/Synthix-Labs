        Case specifications length width finished, Solidworks 
        Waiting on CherryMX low profile switches specifications to determine hole size.

        Research on mechanism, snapping, latching early because case needs it for the parts,
        the case needs advanced mechanism that i had net learned. proficienty in solidworks needed

        Decided on every component would need modularity 

        Switch to FUSION 360 since SolidWorks is too complicated.
