        Case specifications length width finished, Solidworks 
        Waiting on CherryMX low profile switches specifications to determine hole size.

        Research on mechanism, snapping, latching early because case needs it for the parts,
        the case needs advanced mechanism that i had net learned. proficienty in solidworks needed

        Decided on every component would need modularity 

        Switch to FUSION 360 since SolidWorks is too complicated. 


        Learned basic controls and tools of Fusion 360

        <pre> Measuring the keycaps, length, depth </pre>
        <pre>
            while finding keycaps i came across a issue that i had to make it in fusion360,
            due to the low existance of low profile keycaps that i wanted, and that they were pretty expensive
            i turned to 3d print them to lower the cost then, send over the specifications to a fabrication plant 
            for it to be doubleshot and in abs or pla.
