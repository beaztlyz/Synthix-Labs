        <p> Learned the basics of CAD Software in Fusion 360 </p>
        <pre>
            learned the extrude tool and fusion360 to ultimaker cura, materials and different thicknesses
        </pre>


        
        <h3> Top Case</h3>
        <pre>
            top case created for keyboard to be slotted out, touchpad and other accessories to be used
            in the future
        </pre>
        
        <h3> Bottom Case </h3>
        <pre> ram is going to be slotted outside to save space for the motherboard. and nvme / ssd</pre>


        <pre> Measuring the keycaps, length, depth </pre>
        <pre>
            while finding keycaps i came across a issue that i had to make it in fusion360,
            due to the low existance of low profile keycaps that i wanted, and that they were pretty expensive
            i turned to 3d print them to lower the cost then, send over the specifications to a fabrication plant 
            for it to be doubleshot and in abs or pla.

    <h3> Reflection </h3>
    <pre> 
        Learned the basics of CAD Software and created a laptop case with it.
        I am on schedule but however the case does not have the features that i would like it to have 
        ports and connectors
