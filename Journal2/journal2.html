    <h2> PCB Conceptualization and Design </h2>
    <pre> 
        Learned:
            Traces:
                -Microtrace
                    Radiates into the air and the plane
                -Stripline 
                    radiates only into the plane in a 360 view
            Plane:
                - Layers of planes
                - Materials
            Via:
                Sizes:
                    Small:
                        - 0.5mm Space, 0.2mm hole
                    Medium:
                        -
                    Large:
                        - 
            EMI:
                Radiation or interference when electicity passes
            
            Electrical Engineering:
                On DC Electricity travels through traces at different voltages depending on if they 
                On AC Electricity travels through the one with the least impedence depending on frequency
                Electricity travels in a line but radiates energy into and out of the board


            IC(Integrated Circuits):
                Learned about the different parts that go into a circuit to make it function


            IEC Symbols are more compact
            Nema rated ones are more expensive but catered to larger devices

          <p>Transistors regulate electricity through traces and wires.</p>

    <h2> Modular Keyboard Keycaps, Switches and Design </h2>



    <pre>
        Learned: 
            Different keycap profiles, 
                Sculpted:
                    Each keycap row has different textures in order to make typing
                    more comfortable 
            
            Measurement:
                Keycaps have a size of 0.75 IN or 1 U - refers to one key size 

                Stabilizers:
                    I need stabilizers for the bigger keys such as tab, space and shift 
                    This will prevent it from wobbling around 

                    


    </pre>

    <h2> Tools learned and Used </h2>
    <pre>
        KICAD - EDA Software 
            Learned how to trace onto a plane of a pcb, change size of via's 
            Place different components that i need 
            
    </pre>



    <h2> Conceptualization</h2>
    <pre> 
        The PCB will have four layers with a custom dimension. 



        <p> Work in progress for Battery schematic </p>

    <h2> Accomplishments</h2>
    <pre> In order to get a hands on experience and learn faster and better
        Developed a concept pcb in which i use EE symbols and IC - Integrated Circuits
        to be able to get a grasp on it, it is all theorethical but logical in which the 
        pcb would function
