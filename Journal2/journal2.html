    <h2> PCB Conceptualization and Design </h2>
    <pre> 
        Learned:
            Traces:
                -Microtrace
                    Radiates into the air and the plane
                -Stripline 
                    radiates only into the plane in a 360 view
            Plane:
                - Layers of planes
                - Materials
            Via:
                Sizes:
                    Small:
                        - 0.5mm Space, 0.2mm hole
                    Medium:
                        -
                    Large:
                        - 
            EMI:
                Radiation or interference when electicity passes
            
            Electrical Engineering:
                On DC Electricity travels through traces at different voltages depending on if they 
                On AC Electricity travels through the one with the least impedence depending on frequency
                Electricity travels in a line but radiates energy into and out of the board

    <h2> Tools learned and Used </h2>
    <pre>
        KICAD - EDA Software 
            Learned how to trace onto a plane of a pcb, change size of via's 
            Place different components that i need 
            
    </pre>



    <h2> Conceptualization</h2>
    <pre> 
        The PCB will have four layers with a custom dimension.
